1. Initialize counters:
   - Set length = 0
   - Set wordCount = 0
   - Set vowelCount = 0

2. Read the sentence as input until a point character is encountered:
   - Repeat the following steps:
     - Read a character from the input.
     - Increment the length counter by 1.
     - If the character is a letter (a-z or A-Z):
       - Convert the character to lowercase.
       - If the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u):
         - Increment the vowelCount counter by 1.
     - If the character is a space:
       - Increment the wordCount counter by 1.

3. Output the results:
   - Display the length of the sentence.
   - Display the number of words in the sentence (wordCount + 1).
   - Display the number of vowels in the sentence.

4. End the algorithm.
